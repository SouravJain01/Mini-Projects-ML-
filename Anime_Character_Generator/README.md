Created an Anime Character Generator using DCGAN on the dataset provided by ![Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aadilmalik94/animecharacterfaces).

Preview of Dataset:-

The result could have been improved, if trained for more hours.But, as this was only to learn DCGAN using pytorch, I terminated the model at 3000th epoch as the final results were good enough to know that it is working properly:-

At Epoch-0 :-

At Epoch-1000 :-

At Epoch-3000 :-

The trained model can be loaded easily using ![this](https://github.com/SouravJain01/Mini-Projects-ML-/blob/master/Anime_Character_Generator/reGENERATOR_3000.pth) for Generator and ![this](https://github.com/SouravJain01/Mini-Projects-ML-/blob/master/Anime_Character_Generator/reDISCRIMINATOR_3000.pth) for Discriminator.
